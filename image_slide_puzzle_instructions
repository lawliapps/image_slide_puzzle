How to Play

Rearrange the tiles by pressing on them and complete the puzzle. At the beginning, 20 maps are available to play but you can unlock new maps by using points.


**Points**

After you complete a map in any of the modes, you'll get some points accordingly. But, you'll be getting more points if it's the first time you have completed the specific map in the specific mode:
